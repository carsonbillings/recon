## Serving the Greater Fresno area

We are proud to provide home inspections to the Greater Fresno area, including foothill and mountain communities such as Coarsegold, Prather, and Squaw Valley. With more than 14 years of experience managing, maintaining, and appraising properties in the Fresno area, it is our goal to exceed all of your home inspection expectations. We use state-of-the-art equipment to examine your home from top to bottom and from the inside out.

Because real estate transactions often happen very fast and rely on quick home inspections, we are available for inspections at your convenience (including weekends and holidays). When you are ready to purchase a new home, let Recon Home Inspectors help you complete a speedy transaction.
