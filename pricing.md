## What is a Home Inspection

A home inspection is a thorough, visual, non-invasive process where the home's systems and components are examined for safety and functionality. A home inspector is limited to inspecting what is readily accessible. This limits us to inspecting systems and components that do not require us to do things such as peel back flooring, open sealed access panels or cut open walls.

All Recon Home Inspectors Reports conform to the [InterNACHI Standards of Practice](https://www.nachi.org/sop.htm) , California Swimming Pool Safety Act [(SB 442, Chapter 670)](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB442), and California Housing Standards, Mold [(SB 655, Chapter 670)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB655).
